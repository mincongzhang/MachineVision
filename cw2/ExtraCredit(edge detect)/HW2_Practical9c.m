% You'll end up calling this function four times (once each with 'll',
% 'lr', 'ul', 'ur'). For each time you'll get an estimated track (2D
% locations over time) of corner of the pattern moved. Note that we're
% saving off the single MAP estimate at each frame, but the particles in
% the Particle Filter are attempting to keep track of the whole posterior
% distribution. 
% 
% Most TO DO parts below should be copy-paste from Practical9a and
% Practical9b.
% 
% Some implementation trivia (i.e. you shouldn't have to worry about
% these changes): 
% MeasurePatchSimilarityHere.m and PatchDistPicker.m have been modifid from
% their previous versions to cope with these particular gray-scale images. 
% If you want to run ExhaustiveTemplateSearchDemo.m, you'll want to run
% with the older versions of those two files (available on Moodle).
