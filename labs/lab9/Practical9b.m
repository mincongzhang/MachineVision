function r=Practical9b
% Part b: Condensation
%
% Now, we will track a given shape (template) as it moves in a sequence of
% frames. Our shape/appearance model is trivial: just a template, given.
% We will only explore simple motion models. Such models may
% contain a variable that switches between cars and pedestrians, or traffic
% in different directions, or accelerating etc.
% 
% Note: depending on the motion model, the state w will have different
% numbers of dimensions (not just 2, though that's the default). 
%
% Most of this algorithm should be copied from Part a. An important
% difference is that now we'll actually compute the likelihood using the
% (provided) MeasurePatchSimilarityHere() function.
%
%
% Complete reamining TO DO parts you didn't answer in Part a, run the code 
% over the sequence, and observe the results. 
%
% Then TO DO:
% - Try varying the number of particles: 2000, 500, 100,...
% - Change the state to have 2 more degrees of freedom: velX and velY.
%   (This will require you to change how state-predictions are made, and 
%   how they are converted to measurement-space)
% - Visualize the top-scoring particles (more than just 1!)
