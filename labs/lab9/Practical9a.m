% Overall, you should learn how to use the Condensation algorithm in this
% practical. 
%
% Part a: Factored Sampling
% This part is mostly illustrative, so you just have a few TODO's.
% Condensation is actually Factored Sampling, but applied iteratively to
% a sequence of observations, and incorporating a motion model. So here,
% time will essentially stand still: given a SINGLE set of "observations",
% can you estimate the posterior probabilities? 
% Observations will be simulated: The real 2D distribution we would like 
% to estimate is the red channel of an abstract image (provided). But
% pretend you can't look at the whole image, and can only take measurements
% here and there. 
% Below, you have the code for factored sampling, but note the comment
% "Loop from here". Looping will only be needed in Part b because we will have a
% changing state, so each loop will advance from t to t+1. Here, you can
% abuse factored sampling a little, and loop "in place". If time were
% advancing and you had a real motion model, that would be Condensation.
% Observe: when you do this factored REsampling, more of the particles 
% should be landing near the peaks in the distribution.
