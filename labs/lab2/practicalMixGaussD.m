function r=practicalMixGaussD

%EXTRA THINGS TO DO (Optional)

%1. Use the mixtures of Gaussians model to classify the skin/non-skin data
%2. Use the Gaussian model (with diagonal covariance) to classify
%face/non-face data (in FaceData.mat)
%3. Use the mixtures of Gaussians model (with diagonal covariance) to
%classify the face/non-face data
%4. Use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution
