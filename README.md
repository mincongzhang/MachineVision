Need further review

lab5 (Dynamic Programming):  
a. dynamic progamming along scanlines  

lab6 (Markov Random Fields):   
a. 5-node grid example in Markov random fields (12.1.1 in the book, page 229)  
b. sampling from probability distributions using MCMC methods (get get gaussMeanXGivenY by conditional distributions)  
c.  MAP inference for binary pairwise MRFs (Gibbs sampling)(new method with much less complexity added)
